# HOW TO REMOVE LINES CONTAINS NON-ALPHANUMERIC CHARACTERS FROM YOUR STRING
Often times, you have many lines of text, for example, you have a big excel file that contains rows after rows and many of those rows contain non alphanumeric characters (a-z,A-Z, 0-9). This app takes your input and put the lines without any strange characters on the result list.
You can add some special characters to the allowed list so they don't be treated as strange characters

Thanks for using the app. Feel free to modify the code. I blog at [https://binarycarpenter.com Binary Carpenter]
